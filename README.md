# FieldKit
FieldKit is a minimal Unity package for creating runtime control panels in interactive installations. It allows you to expose and tweak script variables (bool, int, float, string, enum) during gameplay without coding UI, using reflection and customizable prefabs.

## Who It's For
Artists and designers building interactive installations or kiosks
Developers needing quick runtime debugging or live parameter adjustment
Anyone wanting prefab-based UI controls that work out-of-the-box

## How To Use
Drop any of the prefabs into a canvas and select a script and a parameter to control

## Installation

Open Unity and go to Window > Package Manager.
Click the + button and select Add package from git URL.
